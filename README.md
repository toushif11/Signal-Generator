# Signal Generator
 The Signal Generator and Visualizer is a Python-based application that allows users to generate and visualize basic waveforms, including sine, square, and triangular waves. This project provides an intuitive interface where users can modify key signal parameters such as 
 frequency, amplitude, and phase, and observe the changes in real time using Matplotlib for plotting.

# Key Features:
  Waveform Generation: The program can generate three types of waveforms:
  
   Sine Wave
   
   Square Wave
   
  Triangular Wave
    

# Technologies Used:
  Python: For the core logic and waveform generation.
  
  NumPy: For efficient mathematical operations, including waveform calculations.
  
  Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the generated waveforms.
